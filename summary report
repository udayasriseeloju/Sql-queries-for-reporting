**Summary Report**

This SQL project demonstrates the creation of a complete sales reporting system using MySQL. It includes database design, data insertion, and analytical reporting queries. The database simulates a small retail environment with customers, products, orders, and order items.

The script builds the database structure, inserts sample data, and generates key business insights through SQL queries. Reports include daily sales totals, average transaction values, and top-performing products. Each report helps in understanding revenue trends, customer spending behavior, and product performance.

The project is designed to run seamlessly in both MySQL Workbench and Visual Studio Code with MySQL extensions. It can be used as a practical reference for learning SQL database creation, data aggregation, and analytical query writing.
